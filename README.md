# Python Data Analytics Projects

A curated collection of Python data analytics projects completed using real-world datasets.  
These notebooks demonstrate skills in **data cleaning**, **EDA**, **visualization**,  
**statistical analysis**, **feature engineering**, and **business insights** using  
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository is designed to showcase end-to-end analytical thinking for  
**data analyst, business intelligence, and data science internship roles**.
